  sub="My research focuses on the dusty debris disks around stars and the search for the planets stirring that dust. I use data from space telescopes like Spitzer and Herschel and powerful ground-based telescopes (Keck and Palomar) to understand how planetary systems form. This page includes summaries of my projects and links to my publications so you can explore the science behind these discoveries."
