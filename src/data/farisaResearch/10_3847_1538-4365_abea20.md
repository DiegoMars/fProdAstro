The ∼200,000 targets monitored for photometric variability during the Kepler prime mission include the best-studied group of stars in the sky, due both to the extensive time history provided by Kepler and to the substantial amount of ancillary data provided by other investigators or compiled by the Kepler team. To complement this wealth of data, we surveyed the entire Kepler field using the 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands of the Warm Spitzer Space Telescope, obtaining photometry in both bands for almost 170,000 objects. We demonstrate relative photometric precision ranging from better than ∼1.5% for the brighter stars down to slightly greater than ∼2% for the faintest stars monitored by Kepler. We describe the data collection and analysis phases of this work and identify several stars with large infrared excess, although none that is also known to be the host of an exoplanetary system. The final catalog resulting from this work will be available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
