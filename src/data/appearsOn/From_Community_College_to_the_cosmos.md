Hispan@s de la NASA‚Äù is an initiative of the NASA Scientific Missions Directorate to highlight the contributions of the Latin community to NASA projects and centers. In each chapter, scientists, engineers and other professionals from all corners of Latin America, Spain, and the U.S. Hispanic community. We tell how they got to NASA and how we accomplished our mission of exploring the Universe and our Planet Earth. Their stories show that no matter where you come from, with hard work and perseverance you can fulfill your dreams.
