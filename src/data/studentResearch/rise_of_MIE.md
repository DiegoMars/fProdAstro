This independent study focused on integrating MIE Theory with an existing Effective Medium Theory (EMT) implementation to calculate dust grain emissivity based on optical constants. The resulting emissivity data was validated and prepared for use in further astrophysical modeling, with output visualizations and data shared via GitHub.
